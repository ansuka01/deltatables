This notebook will init and create a table from csv that contains all of the product information about Alko's products. Then it changes/casts some column names to a bit better ones, like removing % signs. After that it creates delta tables that contain all of the red wines and white wines. These tables can be queried very easily and you can perfom operations like joins etc on them
